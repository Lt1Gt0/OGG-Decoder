# Ogg decoder

## About
Very simple bare bones ogg file decoder

I am aware of different libraries that do the work of decoding files like [ffmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/), [libvorbis](http://vorbis.com/) and [Tremor](https://wiki.xiph.org/Tremor) to name a few, I just wanted to see how decoding these files worked and if I was able to implemet a decoder for a few of them

## TODO

- File Mappings
(for the record I did not look into all of these
extensively so I don't know if each one is possible
implement from an open source standpoint)
